Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.

## General Idea

I think it would be cool to have a sort of documentation blog, mostly code focused, where you can post code or examples, and others can suggest edits to this code. I've always enjoyed when documentation allows you to edit items, as good documentation is the source for a lot of good in the open source community.

Broad idea, imagine documentation where people can contribute and get a kickback for contributing and maintaining good documentation. Web3 enables this.
